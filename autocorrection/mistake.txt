Last weekend, I decided to take a short break from my usual routine and go for a walk near the lake. The weather was calm, and the sky had a soft orange glow as the sun began to set. Birds were gliding over the water, and a gentle breeze made the trees sway rhythmically. I sat on a wooden bench, listened to some music, and watched the reflections ripple across the surface. It was one of those peaceful moments where everything just felt right.
